# Car-price-predictor
Created a ML project where we can predict the price of second hand cars using the dataset of second hand cars. We used ExtraTreeRegressor machine learning model/ algorithm to train the data set and on that trained dataset we predicted the price using various dependent variables such as car company, model, fuel type, age of car, etc.
